# DC Bike Share Data Analysis

This project explores 3 years of public bike rental data in Washington DC using Python. It includes exploratory data analysis, time series visualization, and machine learning modeling to predict ride counts.

## Key Components

- Exploratory Data Analysis (Pandas, Seaborn)
- Time Series Trends (daily rentals, seasonality)
- Supervised Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, Polynomial Regression
- Data visualization using Matplotlib, Plotly
- Notebooks structured for modular review

## Notebooks

- `01_EDA.ipynb`: Usage trends, user types, hourly patterns
- `02_TimeSeries.ipynb`: Rentals over time and seasonality
- `03_ML_Modeling_RF_XGB.ipynb`: Feature selection, RF vs. XGBoost
- `04_Polynomial_Regression.ipynb`: Curve fitting on ride prediction

## Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
